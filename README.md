# Objective
This repo will provide resource materials and references to support the Real World Data Analytics Bootcamp. 

# Overview
The age of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and more specifically Generative AI - has spawned an ecosystem of opportunities  for those brave, passionate or shrewd enough to pursue it.

Unfortunately, the pace at which the Data Science field is evolving, makes it very difficult for traditional large-scale institutions to pivot and modify their curriculum. As such, there are fewer options available to formally learn, train and adopt to these emerging standards.

This repo will provide a resource to help newbies and transients gain some insight around the core body of knowledge needed to launch their career in the fiend of Data Analytics.
